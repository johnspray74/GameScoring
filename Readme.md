# Game Scoring project example for ALA (Abstraction Layered Architecture)

This is one of the demonstration projects for the documentation at abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com.
The project implements a game scoring application for Tenpin Bowling using ALA, and then uses the domain abstractions to demonstrate 'maintainability' by implementing a Tennis scoring application.

## Getting Started

1. Read abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com to understand the architeture of the code.

2. Inspect the code of the aplications and/or the domain abstractions to see the example of ALA structure.

Optional:

3. Install Visual Studio for C# community edition.

4. Clone this git repsoitory.

5. Run the tests.

6. Run the console application.

## Running the tests

In Visual Studio, open a test file, right click a test set, and run the tests.
