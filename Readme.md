# Game Scoring project example for ALA
(Abstraction Layered Architecture)

This is one of the demonstration projects for the documentation at abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com.

The project implements a game scoring application for Tenpin Bowling using ALA, and then uses the domain abstractions to demonstrate 'maintainability' by implementing a Tennis scoring application.

## Getting Started

1. Read some of abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com until you get the insights behind Abstraction layered Architecture. The web site is organised in passes that go into more depth, and each pass ends with an example project. The Bowling and Tennis applications are used as the examples at the end of passes 2 and 4. 

2. Read the code of the aplications Tennis.c and Bowling.c to see how they reflect the ALA diagrams. With knowledge of ALA, they should be readable on their own after learning the domain abstractions they use. The diagrams will be added here soon.

Optional:

3. Read the code inside the domain abstractions to see how they work internally.

3. Install Visual Studio for C# community edition.

4. Clone this git repsoitory.

5. Run the tests.

6. Run the console application by pressing F5. Change to the other application by modifying Start.cs.

## Running the tests

In Visual Studio, view the test explorer. Click Run All.

## Acknowledgments

* Robert Martin provided inspiration for the idea of using Tenpin Bowling scoring as a pedagogical sized project or Kata. Here it is used as an example project for ALA. However, this project implements a scorecard as you would see in a real bowling game, whereas most internet examples you will see just return the total score.
